Figure: GAN process

Imitation of Claude Manet Art work from real images (GAN)

Menet art work is basically creating a painting nature the way he percieves it. He was the Impressionist who captured the feeling of being in nature the most, and he never stopped painting all the beautiful things he saw.
Here, algorithm will be use to develop painting-like of his work. in other words, about 7,000 to 10,000 MOnet style images will be generated using GAN.

Figure: Generator and Discriminator Loss 

The first code "I_AM_SOMETHING_OF_A_PAINTER_MYSELF." is a technique i'm developing to generate a real image that looks like a real photo>
More task is on the run to be done

Generated Monet-Like image for further fine tuning with computatinoal resources
